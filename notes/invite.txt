the new UI doesn't have the 'request to join project' / 'invite to edit' system
so now we can't add anonymous users to projects

the old way:
- they click 'request to join'
  - UI is gone, but Snail can still send request over OT socket, possible
- you click 'invite to edit'
  - UI is gone, impossible

the current way:
- click share
- find user by login or email address
  - anonymous user has no login or email address, impossible
- Glitch sends them an email
  - anonymous user has no email address, impossible
- they click the link in the email to join

maybe through teams?
- you create a team
- you invite the anonymous user
  - basically the same interface, you can't find an anonymous user, impossible
- you add the project to the team
- they click 'join this team project'
  - UI is gone, but Snail can still access the API, possible

maybe the other way through teams?
- they create a team
  - anonymous users not allowed to create team, impossible
- they invite you to team
  - goes through your email, really lame, but possible
- you click a thing to accept
- you add the project to the team
- they click 'join this team project'
  - UI is gone, but Snail can still access the API, possible

the self-xss way:
- you run `await application.glitchApi().v0.createProjectPermission(application.currentProject().id(), theirUserId, 20);`
  - you have to open the developer console, really lame, but possible
  - mobile has no developer console, impossible
