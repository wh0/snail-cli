## node (engine)

Continuing supporting >=10.
10.x is no longer supported, but it plays an important role in Glitch, where
it's the interpreter for the in-container software.

## commander

Can't update to 8.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## node-fetch

Can't update to 3.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## socket.io-client

Stuck on 2.x because Glitch's WeTTY server uses version 2.x.

## ws

Sticking to 7.4.x, to match engine.io-client so that we don't install a
separate copy.

Boycotting 8.x because of
https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e173423c180dc1e4e6ee8938d9e4376a7a8b9757.
