## node (engine)

Continuing supporting >=10.
10.x is no longer supported, but it plays an important role in Glitch, where
it's the interpreter for the in-container software.

## commander

Can't update to 8.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## eslint

Can't update to 8.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## events

Webpack depends on events for some reason.
As a separate problem, TypeScript incorrectly resolves `require('events')` to
this package instead of Node.js's built-in module.
And events doesn't satisfy the type checking configuration we're using.

## form-data

Want to remove this, but node-fetch alone can't send a known-length file to S3.
This pulls in mime-db, which is large compared to this project.

## node-fetch

Can't update to 3.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## socket.io-client

Stuck on 2.x because Glitch's WeTTY server uses version 2.x.

## typescript

Can't update to 5.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## webpack-cli

Can't update to 5.x until we raise our minimum node version.

## ws

Sticking to 7.5.x, to match engine.io-client so that we don't install a
separate copy.
