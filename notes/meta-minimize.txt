It would be nice to minimize our single-file bundle.

However:

- Let's not do that unless we can also release a source map.
- webpack can generate a source map, but it would get messed when we add the
  shebang in build.sh.
- webpack has BannerPlugin that can add the shebang natively.
- BannerPlugin makes source map generation silently fail.

Thus as this time we have no satisfactory way to do it.
